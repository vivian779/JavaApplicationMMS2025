c) //
d) Space,tab and newline
e) keywords
f) main
g) print(),println(),printf()

Exercises 2.2
a) False
Explanation: // starts a comment, and comments are ignored during execution.
b) True
c) False
Explanation: Java is case sensitive and won’t consider the variable number and NuMbEr as identical
d) Fales
Explanation: The % operator works with both integers and floating-point numbers (double, float), not just integers.
e) False
Explanation: // starts a comment, and comments are ignored during execution.

Exercises 2.3
2.3 Write statements to accomplish each of the following tasks: 
a) Declare variables c, thisIsAVariable, q76354 and number to be of type int.
Answer: // int c, thisIsAVariable, q76354, number;
 b) Prompt the user to enter an integer. 
Answer: //System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
c) Input an integer and assign the result to int variable value. Assume Scanner variable input can be used to read a value from the keyboard.
Answer: // int value = input.nextInt();
 d) Print "This is a Java program" on one line in the command window. Use method System.out.println. 
Answer: System.out.println("This is a Java program");
e) Print "This is a Java program" on two lines in the command window. The first line should end with Java. Use method System.out.printf and two %s format specifiers. 
Answer:
System.out.printf("%s%n%s%n", "This is a Java", "program");
f) If the variable number is not equal to 7, display "The variable number is not equal to 7”
Answer: 
if (number != 7) {
    System.out.println("The variable number is not equal to 7");
}

Exercises 2.4
2.4 Identify and correct the errors in each of the following statements: 
a) if (c < 7); System.out.println("c is less than 7"); 

Answer: 
int c = 4;
if (c < 7) {
    System.out.println("c is less than 7");
}

b) if (c => 7) System.out.println("c is equal to or greater than 7");
Answer:
int c = 7;
if (c >= 7) {
    System.out.println("c is equal to or greater than 7");
}

Exercises 2.7
2.7 Fill in the blanks in each of the following statements: 
a) Comments are used to document a program and improve its readability. 
b) A decision can be made in a Java program with a(n) if statement. 
c) Calculations are normally performed by assignment statements. 
d) The arithmetic operators with the same precedence as multiplication are division (/) and remainder(%) . 
e) When parentheses in an arithmetic expression are nested, the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first.
 f) A location in the computer’s memory that may contain different values at various times throughout the execution of a program is called a(n) variable.
 2.8 Write Java statements that accomplish each of the following tasks: 
a) Display the message "Enter an integer: ", leaving the cursor on the same line. 
Answer: System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
b) Assign the product of variables b and c to variable a.
Answer: a = b * c;
 c) Use a comment to state that a program performs a sample payroll calculation. 
Answer: // This program performs a sample payroll calculation

Exercises 2.9
 State whether each of the following is true or false. If false, explain why.
 a) Java operators are evaluated from left to right. 
Answer: False
Explanation:
Operators follow precedence rules first (*, /, % before +, -).
If operators have the same precedence, then they are evaluated left to right.

b) The following are all valid variable names: _under_bar_, m928134, t5, j7, her_sales$, his_$account_total, a, b$, c, z and z2. 
Answer: True
c) A valid Java arithmetic expression with no parentheses is evaluated from left to right. 
Answer: False
d) The following are all invalid variable names: 3g, 87, 67h2, h22 and 2h. 
Answer: Explanation:
h22 is valid because it starts with a letter.
The others are invalid because they start with numbers.

Exercises 2.10
 Assuming that x=2 and y=3, what does each of the following statements display? 
a) System.out.printf("x = %d%n", x); 
Answer: X = 2
b) System.out.printf("Value of %d + %d is %d%n", x, x, (x + x));
Answer:  Value of 2 + 2 is 4

c) System.out.printf("x ="); d) System.out.printf("%d = %d%n", (x + y), (y + x)); 
Answer: X = 

Exercises 2.11
 Which of the following Java statements contain variables whose values are modified? 
a) p=i+j+k+ 7; 
Answer: Yes — modifies p.
b) System.out.println("variables whose values are modified");
Answer: NO — just prints text. c) System.out.println("a = 5"); 
Answer: No — prints text only, does NOT change variable a.
d) value = input.nextInt(); 
Yes — modifies value.

Exercises 2.12
Given that y = ax3 + 7, which of the following are correct Java statements for this equation? 
a) y=a*x*x*x+ 7; incorrect
b) y = a * x * x * (x + 7); incorrect
c) y = (a * x) * x * (x + 7); incorrect
d) y = (a * x) * x * x + 7; correct
e) y = a * (x * x * x) + 7; correct
f) y = a * x * (x * x + 7);
 
Exercises 2.13
 State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following Java statements, and show the value of x after each statement is performed:
 a) x = 7 + 3 * 6 / 2 - 1; 
Answer: x = 15
b) x = 2 % 2 + 2 * 2 - 2 / 2;
Answer: x = 3
c) x=(3 * 9 * (3 + (9 * 3 / (3)))); 
Answer: x = 324
The precedence of the operators is as follows
1.	Parentheses ()
2.	*, /, %
3.	+, -
Left → Right when same level
