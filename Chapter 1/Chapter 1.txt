Exercises 1.8
1) Object:
An object is a real-world entity.
A wrist watch is an object because it exists physically and has characteristics and behaviors

2) Attributes (State)
Attributes are the data or characteristics of an object.
For a wrist watch, attributes may include:
	•	Time (hour, minute, second)
	•	Date
	•	Color
	•	Brand
	•	Battery level

3) Behaviors (Methods)
Behaviors are the actions an object can perform.
A wrist watch can:
	•	Display time
	•	Set time
	•	Set alarm
	•	Turn on light
	•	Start/stop stopwatch

4) Class
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
For example:
	•	“WristWatch” is a class.
	•	My personal Casio watch is an object created from that class

5) Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties of another class.
For example:
	•	A basic class: Watch
	•	A derived class: AlarmClockWatch
The alarm clock watch inherits:
	•	Time display
	•	Date display
And adds new features like:
	•	Alarm sound
	•	Snooze function

6) Modeling
Modeling means creating a representation of a real-world object in software.

7) Messages
A message is a request sent to an object to perform a behavior.
For example:
	•	Pressing the “Set” button sends a message to the watch to change the time.
	•	In programming, calling setTime() sends a message to the object.

8) Encapsulation
Encapsulation means bundling data and methods together in one unit (the object).
The watch keeps:
	•	Its time data
	•	Its alarm data
	•	Its functions

9)Interface
The interface is how users interact with the object.
For a wrist watch, the interface includes:
	•	Buttons
	•	Touch screen
	•	Display screen

10) Information Hiding
Information hiding means keeping internal details private.
For example:
	•	You can see the time on the watch.
	•	But you cannot see the internal gears or electronic circuits.

⸻

5. Hyundai Sonata Hybrid
	•	City MPG: ~44 mpg
	•	Highway MPG: ~51 mpg
	•	Combined MPG: ~47 mpg
	•	Attributes: midsize sedan with long driving range and high fuel economy for its class. ￼

⸻

🔋 Common Hybrid Vehicle Attributes

📊 Fuel Economy
	•	City MPG: Often higher than highway because regenerative braking recovers energy. ￼
	•	Highway MPG: Slightly lower or similar to city for many hybrids. ￼
	•	Combined MPG: Weighted average of city + highway.

⸻

⚙️ Powertrain Design
	•	Gasoline Engine: Usually 1.5–2.5 L inline gasoline engine.
	•	Electric Motor: Provides torque at low speeds and assists acceleration.
	•	Transmission: Often a CVT (continuously variable transmission) optimized for hybrid usage.

⸻

🔋 Battery Attributes
	•	Type: Most hybrids use lithium-ion or nickel-metal-hydride batteries. ￼
	•	Capacity: Typically ~1.0–1.6 kWh (much smaller than plug-in EV batteries). ￼
	•	Weight: Battery packs can add 20–40 kg+ depending on capacity. ￼
	•	Location: Often under the rear seats or trunk floor to balance weight and preserve cargo space.

[1:44 PM, 2/15/2026] Morrison Vivian: Procedure (Algorithm)
	1.	Prepare the replacement list
Create a list (or table) of gender-specific words and their neutral replacements.
Example:
	•	wife → spouse
	•	husband → spouse
	•	man → person
	•	woman → person
	•	daughter → child
	•	son → child
	2.	Read the paragraph word by word
Start from the first word and move through the paragraph one word at a time.
	3.	Check each word
For each word:
	•	Compare it with the words in your replacement list.
	•	If it matches exactly, replace it with the neutral word.
	•	If it does not match, leave it unchanged.
	4.	Preserve punctuation and capitalization
	•	If the original word is capitalized (e.g., “Man”), the replacement should also be capitalized (“Person”).
	•	Keep commas, full stops, and other punctuation marks in their correct positions.
	5.	Continue until the end of the paragraph
Repeat the process until every word has been checked
